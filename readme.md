_**Branch- change1:**_

**motor panel:**
    motor controller current (add a string "A" after value or the SI unit)
    left motor current (A)
    right motor current (A)
    left motor temperature (C)
    right motor temperature (C)
    motor controller temperature (C)
_changes for these are done :) includes adding labels to the sizers._
_forgot to change the timer functions, completed that too_

**MPPT panel:**
    Solar Panels -> MPPT (A)
    MPPT -> Battery (A)
_completed changes in panel to accomodate these_

**Battery:**
    battery(NW) temp -> (C)
    battery(NE) temp -> (C)
    battery(SW) temp -> (C)
    battery(SE) temp -> (C)
    max discharge current -> (A)
    min discharge current -> (A)
    max current -> (A)

**General:**
    speed(FLW) -> (km/h)
    speed(FRW) -> (km/h)
    speed(BBW) -> (km/h)
    speed(BRW) -> (km/h)
    SOC -> (km/h)
